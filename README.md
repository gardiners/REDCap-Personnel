# REDCap-Personnel - a simple trial personnel document tracket for REDCap

This REDCap project template allows for tracking of a few key personnel-related documents over the lifespan of a clinical trial (or trials). Each team member has a record; each document type is its own instrument. By repeating the document instruments over time (ie uploading a new version of each document as it becomes available), a complete, auditable point-in-time record of personnel documents is made.

The instruments are designed to be used as surveys, so that personnel can upload their own documents in a self-serve manner, as the documents expire. The only instrument that the project manager should need to complete is a "Details" form for each record.

This is a work-in-progress project of the Department of Cell and Molecular Therapies, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney Local Health District.
